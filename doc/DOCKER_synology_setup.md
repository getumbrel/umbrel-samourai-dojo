- Open SSH terminal to your Synology
- Follow `first-time install procedure` in [DOCKER_setup.md](DOCKER_setup.md#install), but skip the first two steps:
```
  * Install Docker and Docker Compose on the host machine and check that your installation is working.
  * Install Tor Browser on the host machine.
```
You can use `/volume1/dojo` as `<dojo_dir>`.
- Install will complete with the following warnings, which you can safely ignore:
```
Attaching to nginx, nodejs, bitcoind, tor, db
nginx       | WARNING: no logs are available with the 'db' log driver

  ![](./static/synology_containers.png)

  * bitcoind
  * db
  * nginx
  * nodejs

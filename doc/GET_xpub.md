# Get HD Account

Request details about an HD account. If account does not exist, it must be created with [POST /xpub](./POST_xpub.md), and this call will return an error.

Data returned includes the unspent `balance`, the next `unused` address indices for external and internal chains, the `derivation` path of addresses, and the `created` timestamp when the server first saw this HD account.

```http request
GET /xpub/:xpub
```

## Parameters
* **:xpub** - `string` - The extended public key for the HD Account
* **at** - `string` (optional) - Access Token (json web token). Required if authentication is activated. Alternatively, the access token can be passed through the `Authorization` HTTP header (with the `Bearer` scheme).

### Example

```http request
GET /xpub/xpub0123456789
```
